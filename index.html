  <h2>Teenager wants to run for local office, but some say she's too young</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center"><strong>By The Washington Post, adapted by Newsela staff on 03.15.17</strong></p>

  <p><span class="number-circle">1</span> In March, the city of Stonecrest, Georgia is holding an election. When it's all over, Mary-Pat Hector could be one of the city's
leaders. She is only 19 years old.</p>
  <p><strong>Activist Since Middle School</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">2</span> Hector has always been very involved in her community. At 11 years old, she noticed crime among young people was increasing in her neighborhood. She put together a protest of 50 students. She wanted to build a new community center. Local leaders ignored her. So she called in to the national radio show of Reverend Al Sharpton. He is a famous civil rights leader who has fought for fair treatment of African-Americans. He came down to Georgia to meet her. The two connected. Sharpton made her, at age 14, a youth leader of his organization. Soon after, Hector was meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House. She joined a talk there on civil rights issues.</p>
  <p><strong>2016 Election Pushed Her To Run For Office</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">3</span> On Election Night in November, Hector and her peers made a promise: to run for public office. Just last year, voters elected to make Stonecrest its own city. Hector, a college student, will run for a City Council government seat in Stonecrest. This would put Hector against four others in her area. Each is hoping for one of the five council seats.</p>
  <p><strong>Other Candidate Claims There Is An Age Requirement</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">4</span> But before Hector could even begin running for office, she faced a challenge from one of the other candidates. The candidate said Hector's young age made her unable to run for office. They wanted her "to wait her turn," she said. To Hector, it made no sense. She was 18, old enough to vote in the upcoming election, so why couldn't she run for office? As someone who had focused her young life on serving others, what message would this send other young people interested in government? And so, she did the only thing she knew how: She kept fighting for what she believed was right.</p>
  <p><strong>We Need Leaders With Different Ages, Too</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">5</span> Marvin Arrington Jr., a local lawyer, helped Hector make her case. She needed to prove to the city government that she should be able to run. The board decided she could remain on the ballot. Arrington said he had followed Hector's career from afar. He wanted to support her. "I think we have to look to influence the younger generation." People talk about having leaders from different races, Arrington says. They talk about having both men and women leaders. But they do not always talk about leaders of different ages. Having the voice of a younger person is important, he said. "She is a breath of fresh air."</p>
   <p><strong>Hector Is Focused On Representing Young People In City</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">6</span> Hector's story received a lot of attention from TV and newspapers. She said it's up to her now to
meet with people in her area. She wants to prove that a 19-year-old woman can do the job.
Hector's election team is made up mostly of young people. She hopes to knock on all 10,000 doors in her area. She is telling voters that she hopes to create jobs. She wants to keep young people in the community.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">7</span> The Stonecrest election takes place March 21. Hector said that the response has been very good. Still, some voters think she's too young to run. One man called her election hopes "cute," she said. Another questioned her ability to balance a government job with her schoolwork. Hector hopes to show other young people that they can have a voice in the government. She says the best way to see change happen is to create it yourself. For Hector, that means working in the government so she hopes to see this goal become reality.</p>
